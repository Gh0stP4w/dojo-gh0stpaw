# Welcome

## 👋 Welcome to GhostPaw's SOC Journey

Hello, security traveler. My name is Erich, but in cyberspace I’m known as GhostPaw—a constantly evolving learner, balancing analytical reason and spiritual intuition as I pursue cybersecurity excellence.

#### 🎯 **What is this project?**

This GitBook is my digital grimoire of knowledge, a compendium of studies and notes as I walk the paths of applied learning.

#### **👨‍💻 Why am I doing this?**

After years of flirting with technical areas such as pentesting, networks and low-level development, I made a strategic decision: to master the field of Defensive Security and enter the market as a Junior SOC Analyst.

> “Learning in silence is good, but sharing while learning is what builds reputation.”

#### 📚 **What you will find here**

* Practical analysis of study modules.
* Reports simulating real investigations.
* Notes on frameworks such as MITRE ATT\&CK, SIEM, Kill Chain, etc.

#### 🌐 **Join me on this journey**

***

⚠️ **Final note:**\
If you came here looking for a study reference, use it at will. But remember: d**on't copy — use it as a spark.**\
Build your own grimoire.

🖤
